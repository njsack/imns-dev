Hi! My name is Nick and this is my development blog. I'm going to make this post short and sweet as I mostly made it to get things kickstarted with Hugo. For those who want to learn more about me and what I do, check out my About page. You can also check out a list of current and completed projects I'm working on here.

Really excited to be kicking off my blog again but I'm even more excited that you decided to stop by and pay a visit. Give me a little bit to get some content going and hopefully in the future you will find something that I've contributed helpful.

Cheers!
